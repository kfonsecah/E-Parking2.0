# Index

Documentation for `session/index`.

This section describes session-related endpoints in the **Park Xpress System**, including:

- Session validation with JWT or NextAuth.
- Session status inspection (active session, last activity).
- Session cleanup and logout.

Use these endpoints to ensure secure session management and prevent multiple active sessions.
