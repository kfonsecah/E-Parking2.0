# 📘 Documentation Summary

## 🧾 Overview

This API documentation covers all key functionalities of the **Park Xpress** parking system backend, including:

- ✅ Vehicle management (entry, exit, live status).
- ✅ User account creation and validation.
- ✅ Daily egress filtering using Costa Rica time (UTC-6).
- ✅ Secure user password encryption with bcrypt.
- ✅ Sequential vehicle reference number generation.
- ✅ Support for versioning (`veh_version`, `users_version`) on updates.
- ✅ Connection to tax records via dynamic retrieval.

The endpoints are structured for clarity, reliability, and audit-readiness — aimed at real-world production usage.

---

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

- Add authentication (e.g., JWT or NextAuth) to sensitive endpoints (`POST`, `DELETE`, `GET` on user or vehicle details).
- Avoid exposing fields like `users_password` in frontend applications.
- Log critical operations such as user creation, vehicle exit, or deletion in an `audit_log`.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Suggestions

- Add input validation schemas (e.g., with Zod or Joi).
- Introduce pagination for vehicle/user `GET` requests.
- Include a `soft delete` mechanism instead of permanent deletions.
- Add unit and integration tests for endpoints (consider `Jest`, `Supertest`).

---

## 📆 Update Strategy

- Use version control via `veh_version` and `users_version` fields to prevent race conditions.
- Use UUID-based `session_id` for login session control instead of just storing tokens.
- Prefer defining constants (e.g., vehicle states `P`, `E`, etc.) as enums to ensure strict typing.
