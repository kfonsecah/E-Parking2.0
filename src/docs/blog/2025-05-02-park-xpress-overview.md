## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of _Park Xpress_ was to build a modern and secure platform that improves the operations of commercial parking lots using up-to-date technologies such as:

- **Next.js + TypeScript** — Modern frontend framework with strong type safety and server-side rendering support.
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** — Powerful ORM for efficient and type-safe interaction with a robust relational database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — Secure authentication mechanism for session management and user identity verification.
- **Docusaurus** — Static site generator used to build structured and readable technical documentation.
- **Git** — Distributed version control system for code collaboration and history tracking.
- **Visual Studio Code Insiders** — Advanced development environment with bleeding-edge features and extensions support.
